# Find-Cash
A PowerShell version of an old program I wrote for training myself to quickly calculate change in my head, just to get a bit more accustomed to PowerShell.

Since I am from the Netherlands, the program also accepts commas as the decimal point between euros and cents. To be more realistic both the exact amount of change and the amount of change rounded to 5 cents are correct, as that's how we do it in the Netherlands.
